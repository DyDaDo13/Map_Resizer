# Map_Resizer
you can resize a map full with '0' and choose the height and width or simply resized itself to screen size

if you want to resize manualy type :

./RESIZER 'path/map.*' sizex sizey format

the "format" is the size in pixel of yours sprites

for exemple a sprite with size of 32 pixels the format is 32


if you want to let the program size your map with the screen size juste type :

./RESIZER 'path/map.*' format


ENJOY !!!
